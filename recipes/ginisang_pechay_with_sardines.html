            <li>2 cans sardines</li>
            <li>1 large tomato (chopped)</li>
            <li>1 medium red onion (chopped)</li>
            <li>5 cloves of garlic (minced)</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon ground pepper</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt (or to taste)</li>
            <li>1/4 cup water</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Wash and prepare the pechay. Remove the ends and then chop into 
                smaller pieces. Separate the stems and the leaves. Transfer them 
                to a container and set aside.</li>
            <li>Heat some oil in a pan. Add the onions and garlic and saute them 
                for a few minutes until aromatic. Add the chopped tomatoes and 
                saute for a few minutes. Gently crush them while sauteing to 
                soften and release the juice.</li>
            <li>Add the sardines including the sauce. You may crush the sardines 
                lightly if you like.</li>
            <li>Once the sauce starts to boil, add the chopped stems of the pechay 
                tagalog. You may add some water to thin out the sauce a little. 
                Cover the pan and let it simmer for a couple of minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the pechay leaves and mix gently. Add around 1/4 cup of water 
                to cook the pechay leaves. Season with salt and pepper. Do a last 
                stir before turning the heat off.</li>
            <li>Transfer the ginisang pechay with sardinas to a serving plate. 
                Enjoy this with a lot of hot steaming rice. Yum!</li>
