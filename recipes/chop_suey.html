        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Fill a bowl halfway with ice and enough water to cover ice. Add ½ 
                teaspoon salt for each quart of water. Set aside.</li>
            <li>In a saucepan over medium heat, bring 3 cups of salted water to a 
                boil. Add carrots and cook for about 1 minute or until half done. 
                With a slotted spoon, remove from pan and plunge into bowl of ice 
                bath. </li>
            <li>Add broccoli and cauliflower to the boiling water and cook for 
                about 2 to 3 minutes or until half-done. With a slotted spoon, 
                remove from pan and plunge into the ice bath.</li>
            <li>Add cabbage to the boiling water and cook for about 30 seconds or 
                until half-done. With a slotted spoon, remove from pan and plunge 
                into the ice bath.
            </li>
            <li>Add peppers to the boiling water and cook for about 30 seconds or 
                until half-done. With a slotted spoon, remove from pan and plunge 
                into the ice bath.
            </li>
            <li> Reserve 2 cups of the poaching liquid (the one used to blanch 
                vegetables).
            </li>
            <li>Drain vegetables from the ice bath when they are cold.
            </li>
            <li>In a wok or wide skillet over medium heat, heat about 2 
                tablespoons of the oil.
            </li>
            <li>Add chicken liver in a single layer and fry until lightly browned 
                on all sides but not fully cooked. Remove from pan and keep warm.
            </li>
            <li>Discard excess oil and wipe down the pan. Add the remaining 1 
                tablespoon of oil and heat.
            </li>
            <li>Add onions and garlic and cook until softened.
            </li>
            <li>Add chicken and cook, stirring regularly, until color changes.
            </li>
            <li>In a bowl, combine the reserved poaching liquid and oyster sauce. 
                Add to the pan and bring to a boil. Continue to cook, skimming 
                scum that may float on top, for about 4 to 5 minutes or until 
                chicken is cooked through. 
            </li>
            <li>Add the liver and cook for 1 to 2 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>Add parboiled vegetables, baby corn, and quail eggs, stirring 
                gently to combine, and cook for about 3 to 5 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>In a bowl, combine ¼ cup of cold water and corn starch and stir 
                until corn starch is dissolved. Add mixture to the pan, stirring 
                gently. Cook for about 1 to 2 minutes or until sauce is thickened.
            </li>
            <li> Season with salt and pepper to taste. Serve hot.
