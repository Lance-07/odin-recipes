# odin-recipes

Odin recipes is one of my very first website as a learner in the odin project. It is a website that showcase all the things I learn in html. 

In this project, I will use basic texts structure in html and other elements and tags like this following:

- paragraph tag
- h1-h6 tag 
- strong tag for importance of a text
- em tag emphasizing the text
- anchor tag for links
- image tag for images
- few attributes like href, and src.
